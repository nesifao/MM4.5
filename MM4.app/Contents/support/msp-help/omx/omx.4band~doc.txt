omx.4band~ - OctiMax 4 Band

Downward Expander:
OctiMax 4 band is equipped with dual band downward expanders, to effectively combat background noise. One band operates on the entire range, and the other band operates on high frequencies only.

Thresholds:  
Thresholds are independent for both bands, specified in dB below full scale.

Input AGC:
OctiMax AGCs normally work above unity gain (gain amplification).

Gating Threshold:  
Affect both the Input and Multiband AGCs. When the input signal drops below the Gating threshold, release will seize. This is useful to prevent background noise build-up.

Attack/Release Parameters:  
Signify "rate", not "time". Higher value = faster. The scale is logarithmic.

Range:  
Specifies how much the AGC may amplify the audio.  OctiMax 4 band always operates at ratio Infinite:1.

Multiband:

Attack/Release Parameters:
Signify "rate", not "time". Higher value = faster. The scale is logarithmic.

AGC Drive:  Gain control before the AGC in each band (B1 to B4).

Output Mix:  
The B1 to B4 out mix controls are gain controls for each band, and are useful as an equalizer.

Final Limiter Drive:  
Gain control before the final limiter.

Internal Presets:  
These presets are to be considered "starting points" and should be tweaked for your particular purpose or desired sound.
Standard - Appropriate for anything, all genres of music, movies, television viewing, etc. 
Pop - Great for any modern genre including rock, country, trance.
Movies - Similar to standard but optimized for dynamic movie soundtracks.
