omx.peaklim~ - OctiMax Peak Lim

Input Gain:  
Scales level to the limiter.

Final Limiter Drive:
Gain control before the final limiter.

Response: Punchy / Smooth  
Controls a tradeoff in the limiter.  
Punchy Response yields extremely short attack and release times, useful for transparent limiting, or to create loudness. However, if over-used, intermodulation distortion may result.  
Smooth uses longer attack and release times - still a fast look-ahead limiter, but much less intermodulation distortion. However, the resulting sound isn't as punchy as with Punchy Response.

Output Gain:  
Scales output level.
